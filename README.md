# Buy-Dip-Strategy---Simulation
A Python-based simulation that visualizes disciplined dip-buying strategies across multiple pullback scenarios. This project models geometric price drops and recoveries, calculates breakeven points, and annotates final portfolio values and returns — helping investors understand how strategic accumulation during dips can outperform passive holding.
